# Redirection Validator
 
## This is a devcontainer for use in VSCODE (or similar).

This container contains a pretty old solution made in 2017 (I think) to validate **A LOT** of redirect mappings, which is especially useful when doing site migrations or moving content around.
 
> **Note:** It works fine, but the sophistication/quality of code is not great. It also marks my last use of JQuery (if I have anything to say about that). It was hacked together very quickly for personal use and I wasn't aware of any of the reactive and very useful libraries I could have used as alternatives for JQuery.

I want to refactor the whole solution and hopefully make it into a Chrome Extension and/or a well-functioning bookmarklet. I did make a very rough bookmarklet, but it's ugly and a poor solution, so it needs to be reworked.

 Anyway, I haven't changed the code for now and the only update really is to "wrap it" in a devcontainer and create a repository for it.

## Here's a few tips:
- Exposed ports are:
   - 8000
- In the terminal, run `php -S 0.0.0.0:8000` to start the app.
- OPCache has been disabled globally _AND_ in the check.php script.

## Try Out Development Containers: PHP

This is a sample project that lets you try out the **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)** extension in a few easy steps.

> **Note:** If you're following the quick start, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.

## Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the "PHP" sample, wait for the container to start and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use **Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem.

   Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

## Things to try

Once you have this sample opened in a container, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

> **Note:** This container runs as a non-root user with sudo access by default. Comment out `"remoteUser": "vscode"` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if you'd prefer to run as root.

Some things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   - Open `index.php`
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features.
1. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `uname` and other Linux commands from the terminal window.
1. **Run and Debug:**
   - Open `index.php`
   - Add a breakpoint (e.g. on line 4).
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
1. **Running a server:**
   - From the terminal, run `php -S 0.0.0.0:8000`
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Forward a Port** command.
   - Select port `8000`.
   - Click "Open Browser" in the notification that appears to access the web app on this new port.
   - Look back at the terminal, and you should see the output from your site navigations
   - Edit the text on line 21 in `index.php` and refresh the page to see the changes immediately take affect
1. **Attach debugger to the server:**
   - Follow the previous steps to start up a PHP server and open a browser on port `8000`
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **View: Show Debug** command
   - Pick "Listen for XDebug" from the dropdown
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to attach the debugger
   - Add a breakpoint to `index.php` if you haven't already
   - Reload your browser window
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
